# Stem Cells

In this repository you will encounter both a algorithm for stem cells differentiation analyses and the following information on the subject of stem cell:

- Classification of the different types of stem cells
- Where stem cells can be found in the human body
- what are the application of the stem cells
- Pros and cons of the use of stem cells in society

## Classification of the different types of stem cells  & Where they can be found
The stem cells can be classified based on the location in which they reside and based on their differentiation characteristic.

- Embryonic stem cells: Embryonic stem cells are consider pluripotent (such have the capability of differentiating into a great variety of different specialized cells) they can be found in the inner cell mass of the human blastocyst, an early stage of the developing embryo lasting from the 4th to 7th day after fertilization.

- Cord blood stem cells: Cord blood stem cells are consider multipotent (such have the capability of differentiating but are more limited than pluripotent cells) as the name indicates such may be encountered in the umbilical cord blood.

- Adult stem cells: Adult stem cells are multipotent (such have the capability of differentiating but are more limited than pluripotent cells) they are a rare populations of cells that are found in the body throughout the majority of postnatal life and give rise to a limited number of mature cell types that build the tissue in which they reside. Their progeny replaces cells that are lost owing to tissue turnover or injury, thus ensuring the maintenance of tissue homeostasis.

## what are the application of the stem cells
When it comes to stem cells there are a variety of different applications of in modern medicine that are being researched some instances of such are the grow new cells in a laboratory to replace damaged organs or tissues, correct parts of organs that don't work properly, research causes of genetic defects in cells, research how diseases occur or why certain cells develop into cancer cells, test new drugs for safety and effectiveness.

Even if the applications shown above may still take time to be adopted and used there are already some applications of stem cells when it comes to stem cells therapies, among which are treatments for spinal cord injury, heart failure, retinal and macular degeneration, tendon ruptures, and diabetes type 1.

## Pros and cons of the use of stem cells in society

There are many ethical debates in relation to the use of stem cells in our society, many arguing in favor of it's use and many against it. As presented in the section `What are the application of the stem cells` there are in fact many benefits in the use of such, applications of which the likes to could change medicine for ever, although it is also arguable that the use of such is unethical due to the fact  that, embryonic stem cells function the same way as typical embryonic cells that give rise to human fetus. Thus, people can regard embryonic stem cells as potential human beings despite of their in vitro origin. And it is an extremely complex task to handle stem cells due to there delicate nature: embryonic cells can have a high rejection rates, adult stem cells have a determined cell type, obtaining any form of stem cell is a difficult process, etc.
